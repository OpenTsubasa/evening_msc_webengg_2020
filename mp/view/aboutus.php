                                    <p>In 2010, Movie Props founder Mr. X's love for movies led him to begin hunting for the same props and costumes that were used to create his favourite films. He found that he could not only provide collectors with access to their most coveted pieces, but also establish archival standards for this new, pop-culture hybrid of fine art and memorabilia collecting - <strong>prop art</strong>.</p>
                                    <p>Once X assembled his dream team of like-minded movie fanatics, Prop Store set out like a band of movie archaeologists, looking to locate, research and preserve the treasure troves of important artifacts that hid in dark, sometimes forgotten corners all over the world.</p>
                                    <p>Now, just five years later, the prop hobby and Movie Props are thriving. With over ten employees between our offices in Europe and America and over 5000 combined square feet of archived props and costumes, we are quickly becoming one of the bigger and trusted authorities in the hobby.</p>
                                    <p>Thinking of starting your own collection? Give us a call or e-mail and we'll arrange a tour through one of our incredible galleries so that you can see the limitless possibilities that await. We may even encourage you to join us ;-)</p>
                                    <p>The reality of owning an authentic prop or costume from your favourite movie could be just a call or click away ... </p>
